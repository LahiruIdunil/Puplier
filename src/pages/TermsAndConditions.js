                give us all the required information.

            <h2>18. General Terms</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>
                These Terms are governed by laws of the United Kingdom, without
                respect to its conflict of laws principles. The sole
                jurisdiction and venue for any claim arising from the Site and
                these Terms will be courts located in the United Kingdom and
                each party hereby consents to the exclusive jurisdiction and
                venue of such courts.
              </li>
              <li>
                These Terms, together with our Privacy Policy and any other
                notices or policies we have published on the Site (and
                additional terms for specific features or areas, as applicable),
                constitute the entire agreement between you and us regarding
                this Site.
              </li>
              <li>
                If a court having proper authority decides that any portion of
                these Terms is invalid, only the part that is invalid will not
                apply. The rest of these Terms will still be in effect. If we
                waive any of our rights under these Terms in any particular
                instance, it does not mean that we are waiving our rights
                generally or in the future. Furthermore, just because we may not
                enforce all our rights all of the time, it does not mean that we
                are waiving our rights. We may decide to enforce them at a later
                date.
              </li>
              <li>
                These Terms, and any rights and licenses granted under these
                Terms, may not be transferred or assigned by you except as
                expressly set forth herein, but may be assigned by us without
                restriction.
              </li>
              <li>
                We won’t be liable to you for any delay or failure to perform
                any obligation we have under these Terms if the delay or failure
                is due to events which are beyond our reasonable control,
                including but not limited to any strike, blockade, war, act of
                terrorism, riot, natural disaster, pandemic, failure or
                diminishment of power or of telecommunications or data networks
                or services or refusal of approval or a license by a government
                agency.
